## Description:
The goal of this project was to make a Recreational Math Selector. A main window will appear and different recreational
math problems can be selected. The two that were implemented were Prime Number Generator and Automorphic Number Generator.
Each were coded separately and then combined in the main window. The generators are hidden until their corresponding button
is pressed. Then the generators can be interacted with or closed. The entire program closes when all windows are closed.

```mainWindow.py``` contains code to run the Recreational Math Selector. From the main window
you can select which Recreational Math Problem to run.

```PrimeNumberGenerator.py``` contains code that only runs the prime number generator

```Automorphic.py``` contains code that only runs the automorphic number generator

```KaprekarsConstant.py``` contains code that only runs the automorphic number generator
